1. [MiXCR](/Tutorials%20&%20Troubleshooting/All/mixcr_manual.md) - Extracts repertores from target amplicon sequencing protocols with and without molecular barcodes, 
shotgun and RNA-Seq libraries, various single cell technologies and is flexible to be tuned for any custom protocol
2. [Download Data From GDC (include TCGA)](/Tutorials%20&%20Troubleshooting/All/Download_data_from_GDC.md) - The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) is a platform that provides access to genomic and clinical data from various cancer research projects, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The GDC serves as a centralized resource for cancer genomics data and offers tools for data analysis and exploration. The data within the GDC is categorized as either open or controlled access. This tutorial will guide you through the process of obtaining controlled data.

3. [Estimating the diversity of immune repertoires](https://repseq-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) - This tutorial covers processing and post-analysis of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing (RepSeq) data. General strategy for such data would be to de-multiplex samples and then map Variable (V), Diversity (D) and Joining (J) segments that are rearranged to form a mature TCR sequence. The complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3), a hypervariable TCR part that defines antigen specificity containing V-(D)-J junction, is then extracted. V, J and CDR3 regions are further assembled into clonotypes.
