### Dani Livne ###

1. [YADA](https://github.com/zurkin1/Yada) - is an innovative biological deconvolution algorithm developed by myself and my collaborator as part of my doctoral research in the Systems Biomedicine Lab under the supervision of Professor Efroni. Its purpose is to estimate the proportions of distinct cell types within complex, heterogeneous gene expression samples.

2. [Pathweigh](https://github.com/zurkin1/Pathweigh) - In order to run PathWeigh please refer to the notebook folder where twe notebooks are availabe. One demonstrating bulk RNAseq data, and the other single-cell RNAseq data.

3. [PathSingle](https://github.com/zurkin1/PathSingle) - In order to run PathSingle please refer to the notebook folder where the notebook is availabe, demonstrating single-cell RNAseq data.

### Miriam Zuckerbrot

1. [Breast Cancer Immune Repertoire Analysis](https://github.com/Miriam-Zu/Breast) - This project involves the analysis of immune repertoire data obtained from the blood samples of healthy donors and breast cancer patients. The immune repertoire data includes T-cell receptor alpha (TRA) and beta (TRB) sequences obtained through Repertoire Sequencing (Rep-Seq). The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature filtering, and machine learning for classification.

2. [Ovarian Cancer Immune Repertoire Analysis](https://github.com/Miriam-Zu/Ovarian) - This project involves the analysis of immune repertoire data obtained from the blood samples of healthy donors and ovarian cancer patients. The immune repertoire data includes T-cell receptor alpha (TRA) and beta (TRB) sequences obtained through Repertoire Sequencing (Rep-Seq). The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature filtering, and machine learning for classification.
