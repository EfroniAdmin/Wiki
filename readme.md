## Welcome Onboard!

In the lab, we study two sources of biological data: Tumor cells and T cells. <br>
We are mostly (although not exclusively) interested in high-throughput data. <br>
Such data allows us to use our strengths, which are in quantitative biology.<br>
 We therefore use these data and produce these data to then utilize data-science methods such as machine learning and network biology to find interesting, novel, insights, that may end-up helping human health.
